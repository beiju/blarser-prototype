This should be split into a GameParser and a GameTransformer. GameParser should
produce an AST of the game and GameTransformer should turn that back into a list
of game events. The tester should verify that the GameTransformer's output is
exactly equal to the input feed events.

Although the end goal is to output ASTs for a whole game, it would probably be
best to start with one event at a time to catch errors sooner.
